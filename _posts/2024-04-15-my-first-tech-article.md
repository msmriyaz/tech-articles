## Introduction

Welcome to the first article in our technical series. This article will guide you through the basics of working with technical documentation and provide a foundation for more advanced topics.

## What You'll Learn

In this article, you'll learn:

- Basic structure of technical documentation
- How to format code examples
- Best practices for organizing information

## Getting Started with Documentation

Good documentation is essential for any technical project. It helps users understand how to use your software, guides contributors who want to help improve it, and serves as a reference for your future self.

### Structure and Organization

Well-structured documentation follows a logical progression:

1. Overview or introduction
2. Installation or setup
3. Basic concepts
4. Detailed functionality
5. Advanced topics
6. Troubleshooting

### Code Examples

Including code examples makes your documentation more practical. Here's a simple example:

```javascript
// A simple function to add two numbers
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// Usage
const result = add(5, 3);
console.log(result); // Outputs: 8
```

## Best Practices

Follow these best practices when writing technical documentation:

- **Be concise** - Use clear, simple language
- **Use examples** - Demonstrate concepts with practical examples
- **Keep it updated** - Outdated documentation can cause more harm than good
- **Include diagrams** - Visual aids help explain complex concepts
- **Link related topics** - Help readers navigate between related articles

## Conclusion
